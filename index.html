The use of Business Information Management/System
In a close link to Star Marketing Agency, the right marketing occurs in the presence of passion, experience, knowledge, vision and curiosity. As a firm that is concern with raising other firms to a competitive level by marketing and enhancing promotion of the products, the company is not the typical business-advertising agency that fits the needs of a specific company. The transactions styles enhances capabilities to approach the marketing challenges from different point of views and employ a wide range of disciplines such as branding, print advertising, promotions, and building collaterals among others.

According to Jin (2005), today it is not wise to confine marketing strategies to the television, radio or print media, the options are quite diverse. The biggest question many people ask regards the effect of technology on advertising especially for the already known products. How would technology enhance advertising when there are already millions of personal views, pod casts and wide direct connections with production companies?

Knowledge Management Systems
One prominent impact of the internet technology is on the creation of a democratic media. The broadcast is international and free, and according to Jin (2005), the highly recognized advertisement sites need to allow personal perspectives and make the aspect of internet publishing easy and accessible to majority without the need for technical knowledge. The available tools ought to promote democracy for the macro-media such as web-blogs, video casts, wikis and pod casts.

The universal knowledge behind the current technological tools enhances knowledge transmission by allowing direct and literal subscription of contents such as the Rich Site Summary (RSS) feed facility, which allows automatic syndication of text, audio or visual data to subscribers. Most of these adopted RSS allow people to publish and update news feeds on the internet. In a close link to Jin’s writing (2005), today people are no longer mare consumers but producers as well because of the ability to produce and share data.

Risk Management
Influences of the social aspects on advertising
The word of mouth especially from someone who is known or trustworthy remains as the best style of advertisement since time in memorial. Compensating the comments by use of advertisements is almost impossible. This form of advertising has come back in form of the internet-based forums on the sites that allow users to place personal comments or requests.

Just like the earlier tittle-tattle conversations, the web sites enjoy incorporation into the databases of common search engines like Google thus becoming recognizable as important sources of information. Many of these real-time comments posted by consumers are enough evidence that the word of mouth is back on a supercharged format.

Professionals would argue that the greatest influence to buying patterns fall upon the brand of the product but the impact of the real-time comments is higher. Majority of the conceivable customers like to base their decisions on the rational world. Internet advertising means that every strength and flaw is available, for instance, if one wanted to acquire a car, it is possible to find some models, their reviews, pricing and the comments some people have over the car.

A willing buyer would want to know what the other person who has experience of the product has to say and pessimistic comments would definitely affect negatively on the sales. Brand building is not the only big influence in today’s advertising territory, as experts would claim. The comments do not create the brand but have great damages in this hyperactively connected world.

The hyperactive connected world phenomenon might be quite new in the advertising industry, but evidently as Star Marketing Agency indicates, the errors committed by companies or its representatives get instant communication today among consumers and may have huge impacts to the business. This is an indication of the power of the electronic billboards, search engines and thus the need for information technology in the advertisement industries.

Today the companies can be able to use the comment related sites to feature available goods or services, find and resolve problems involving common sales. Before embracement of technology, the foundations for most advertisement were supporting ‘information asymmetry’ phenomenon (Levitt and Dubner, 2006). Most company fails to reveal truthful information because of aims for easy influences to target groups or change on negative public perception as a strategy of influencing the market.

The companies whose products experienced market inferiority complex utilize the strategy as well. The effect of such advertisement campaign on the hyperactive connected markets would face zero-rating by the fact that the consumers have knowledge and expertise to tap information from the huge base of consumer comments. The clients have the ability to know any inferiority complexes facing some products in the market even in good time. The connecting technologies have enhanced information symmetries.

In line with Levitt and Dubner (2006), the connected clients do not face high advertisements influences in comparison to their unconnected counterparts. Technology leaves no room for advertisement lies thus promoting fair transparent communication. There is enough information access and thus consumers can enjoy fair judgement over advertisement campaigns and invalidate the questionable ones whenever they find the need to (Levitt and Dubner, 2006).

The new advertisement language
The commercial massages are no longer in use today, in a close link to Star Marketing Agencies, clients want the great life comments from experiences that fellow consumers have had with particular services or goods. They prefer reading information from the company’s site as opposed to basing their judgements on commercial advertisements through the media. The mobile technology enables the client to connect at free will and reach out for third person’s opinion or find some technical information to make good decisions.

Customers wish to talk to the companies other than getting information through the traditional advertisements thus the need to adopt a technologically based language. This calls for the need to use advertising as a tool for conversing with the micro targets as opposed to the large target groups. The consumer/company relationship overrules the possibility of faking the information regarding advertisements. With this kind of system, it is also easy to identify faking of comments posted among internet users.

Personification cannot workout in the new advertising mechanisms of “blogging”. Arguably, the internet commenting technology takes the natural human tone of communication. Detection of fraudsters by users can easily occur owing to the concept in unique styles of the chat rooms.

Systems Developments
The mobile telephony industry is under constant and effective growth to enable clients to have their personal opinions. It utilizes transmission of audio data, short messaging texts (SMS), e-mails, the multimedia messages texts, picture messages and broadcasting services (Tahtinen and Salo, 2004).

Mobile governance in businesses involves the extension of concepts of governing to deliverance of information, goods or services to the clients in a civilized and personalised manner (Tahtinen and Salo, 2004). The advancement of technology influences the way information is accessible as well as the point of origin. The mobile commerce is a concept that has improved widely in reference to distribution of text or multimedia messages in the aim of enhancing business activities (Barnes and Scornavacca, 2004).

The cell phones industry currently takes control of the information transfer field with ease because of the low and fundamental initial setup costs involved. The user experience and business models especially in developing countries remain a big hindrance to its full adoption. The various methods of mobile advertising such as the “WAP banners and the event oriented” texts fail to meet the satisfaction because they lack enough advertisers confidence as well as the creativity required to capture client’s attention.</p>
